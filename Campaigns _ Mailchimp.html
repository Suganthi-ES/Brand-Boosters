These nutrients are often added to soil through fertilizers, compost, and other organic matter.It is important to note that too much of a good thing can be harmful to plants. Excessive nutrients can lead to nutrient imbalances and toxicity. \u00a0Understanding soil composition and fertility is key to providing the optimal growing conditions for your plants.","email_templates.placeholder_content_29ac026d29c538244f7b8a7505213750":"TIPS","email_templates.placeholder_content_c438cbddd1234c75e7c52fd98c82d2f8":"Propagate Your Plants for More Greenery","email_templates.placeholder_content_c842366610617e5775e55283380c9dd7":"Learn more \u2192","email_templates.placeholder_content_4d9e805f5444c7a67e0136bbb92a1c12":"DESIGN","email_templates.placeholder_content_2c6dfebf41addb29f74fff0874f3f5c8":"How to Choose the Right Pot for Your Plant","email_templates.placeholder_content_0a08c94136c483e87794e66ec59a4a8a":"Read now \u2192","email_templates.placeholder_content_785a1e256fca0cd6be7b3dced4281845":"HEALTH","email_templates.placeholder_content_cc46f3ae73c26c20bf85687a4fc03a81":"A Playlist Can Benefit Your Plants","email_templates.placeholder_content_19a529f241585ecb385059c5c9bf4221":"Listen now \u2192","email_templates.placeholder_content_12f198fd247ce097fdceb58f0583e3ef":"WELCOME TO","email_templates.placeholder_content_c55f714303bc036e7b1bcc91a4ce55ce":"The Potted Planter is a community of gardening newbies and green thumbs who believe plants are people, too.","email_templates.placeholder_content_cd5e4a1ae7da19f889fcd7bae7de70ab":"EXPLORE THE SHOP","email_templates.placeholder_content_9ec950323822aea0130876c6bf6d5d13":"GET PLANT TIPS","email_templates.placeholder_content_4389407ad8b36316f3ac759b6fced175":"VISIT THE GREENHOUSE","email_templates.placeholder_content_ee82cf273489a4baa84697d868001821":"BOOK A WORKSHOP","email_templates.placeholder_content_518110a1f062beedbbd71c0a572a3edf":"Join ","email_templates.placeholder_content_392ec2c6f17a92527c69abba4276e6ed":"Amilia","email_templates.placeholder_content_5befc4d6d157eea621aaa475fac31d21":" every","email_templates.placeholder_content_f1c98b592e17fd00f7281cc536796b99":"other SATURDAY for","email_templates.placeholder_content_f6eebf99e2184d946dfd864ac04da244":"Seasonal Workshops","email_templates.placeholder_content_fb78ab45dd1508ca5a7697d7d8d06803":"that will ","email_templates.placeholder_content_27d44ca6e4d6cdd167fbcf424ac91efb":"educate","email_templates.placeholder_content_340d3976502f18df7a2a0fe5a900450c":" &","email_templates.placeholder_content_6dca4fe9cc3dfa1e593e1a60462b55c4":"inspire","email_templates.placeholder_content_eefbab739d159313c540cdfefd4ae61f":" plant owners","email_templates.placeholder_content_36d26a12188bc34ea732001f1c849bd3":"OF ALL LEVELS.","email_templates.placeholder_content_d943b9708405cb560c5eea6c080b145e":"Every Saturday","email_templates.placeholder_content_1d270a42cf5bec31d72ba3dc269cd2ac":"1pm - 3pm","email_templates.placeholder_content_100f8944d6c50cf7aaf50f00b5d46c6b":"05 \/ 13","email_templates.placeholder_content_2c90ed2696f400744924a6af3cbd7ca4":"Seed Starting Workshop","email_templates.placeholder_content_7d9f8546de6cd325ae20177519f02f83":"Learn how to start seeds and get tips on selecting the right soil, and containers.","email_templates.placeholder_content_0ba7583639a274c434bbe6ef797115a4":"Register","email_templates.placeholder_content_408a8b2628356ff53e4dc09994a68249":"05 \/ 20","email_templates.placeholder_content_ad02a01b65a11efcf9f9c4c23d17b162":"Plant Care & Maintenance","email_templates.placeholder_content_41b12a5646b6c9f8579189acabe769ab":"Understand the needs of your plants and prepare them for for a new season.","email_templates.placeholder_content_1a56019ba9fb774babb18b138c9d66e6":"05 \/ 27","email_templates.placeholder_content_45922bad24450ff56457dc9393fb9bcb":"Greenhouse Gardening","email_templates.placeholder_content_9054acd430a9ba04a027971862322790":"Learn about cultivating thriving plants in a greenhouse environment.","email_templates.placeholder_content_040f83f2d32280b1ef36354209271fe0":"THANK YOU FOR 5 YEARS!","email_templates.placeholder_content_96c0ce08899aad75dafcd1286f18d460":"FOR 15% OFF","email_templates.placeholder_content_75339bbdd2a555542e24d776dcde4574":"USE CODE \"THANKS\u201d","email_templates.placeholder_content_ce4c416f1add2078d026dbc6931d2aff":"Thank you for being with us since day one.

It's a direct and immediate way to engage with customers, and drive engagement or conversions through concise and targeted messaging.","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_two":"SMS marketing offers several advantages for businesses. Most importantly, it provides a direct and immediate way to reach your audience, as most people carry their mobile phones with them at all times. Its concise and targeted nature makes it ideal for time-sensitive promotions, reminders, or urgent updates. Text messages also have high open and read rates, which improves the odds of your content being seen. Additionally, SMS marketing is a great channel for personalization, and can be used to engage customers with exclusive offers and content. When used right, it can be a powerful tool for driving engagement, conversion, and brand loyalty.","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_three_p1":"<li>Best practices for bringing SMS marketing campaigns into your business include:<\/li><li>Get consent: Obtain permission from customers to receive SMS messages by offering opt-in opportunities through your website, social media, and email campaigns.<\/li><li>Keep it brief: Create concise and engaging SMS messages that provide value to your audience. Make use of personalization, a clear call-to-action, and a sense of urgency when appropriate.<\/li><li>Know your audience: Use SMS marketing automation to divide your subscribers into segments based on demographics, preferences, or purchase history. This allows for targeted messaging and better response rates.<\/li><li>Test and optimize: Experiment with different timing and message formats to dial in the resonance with your audience. Use analytics to track performance and make data-driven optimizations.<\/li><li>Make unsubscribing easy: Even though you have consent to send text messages, people have the right to change their minds. Include a simple unsubscribe link (or instructions) at the end of every marketing text.<\/li>","sms_overview.zero_state_faqs.answer_three_p2":"With solutions such as Mailchimp, you can optimize your SMS marketing campaigns with collected data and analytics in real-time.
